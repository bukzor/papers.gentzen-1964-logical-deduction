Even now new inference figures are required that
cannot be integrated into our system of introduc-
tions and eliminations; but we have the advantage
of being able to reserve them special places within
our system, since they no longer refer to logical
symbols, but merely to the structure of the formulae.
We therefore call these "structural inference
figures," and the others "operational inference
figures."

In the *classical* calculus 𝒩𝒦 the law of the
excluded middle occupied a special place among
the forms of inference (II, 5.3), because it could
not be integrated into our system of introductions
and eliminations. In the classical logistic calculus
ℒ𝒦 to be presented below, that peculiarity is
removed. What makes this possible is that we
admit into our system sequents with *several* formulae
in the succedent, whereas the indicated transition
from the calculus 𝒩𝒥 has resulted only in sequents
with *one* formula in the succedent. (For the
intuitive meaning of the general sequents cf. I, 2.4.)
The symmetry thus obtained is more suited to
classical logic. On the other hand, the restriction
to at most one formula in the succedent will be
retained for the intuitionist calculus ℒ𝒥. (Cf. below
—An empty succedent means the same as if 𝔽 stood
in the succedent.)

We have thus outlined a number of points that
underlie the construction of the calculi that follow.
Their form is largely determined, however, by
considerations connected with the "*Hauptsatz*"
(§2) whose proof follows later. That form cannot
therefore be justified more fully at this stage.

1.2. We now define the concepts of a "ℒ𝒦–
derivation" and a "ℒ𝒥–derivation" as follows:

An ℒ𝒥– or ℒ𝒦–derivation consists of sequents
arranged in tree form (I, 3.3).

The *initial sequents* of the derivation are basic
sequents of the form

**D ⟶ D,**

where **D** may be an arbitrary formula.

Each *inference figure* of the derivation results
from one of the schemata below by a substitution of
the following kind (cf. II, 2.21):

Replace **A, B, D, E** by arbitrary formulae; for
∀ 𝔵𝔉𝔵 (∃𝔵𝔉𝔵) put an arbitrary formula having
∀ (∃) for its terminal symbol, where 𝔵 designates
the associated bound object variable; for **F𝔞**
put that formula which is obtained from **F𝔵** by
replacing every occurrence of the bound object
variable 𝔵 by the free object variable 𝔞.
