By means of a number of examples we shall first
of all show what form actual reasoning tends to take
and shall examine, for this purpose, three "valid
formulae" and try to see their validity in the most
natural way possible.

1.1. *First example*:
(𝑋∨(𝑌&𝑍))⊃((𝑋∨𝑌)&(𝑋∨𝑍)) can be re-
cognized as a valid formula (H–A, p. 28, formula
19).

The argument runs as follows. Suppose that
either 𝑋 or 𝑌&𝑍 holds. We distinguish the two
cases: 1. 𝑋 holds, 2. 𝑌&𝑍 holds. In the first case it
follows that 𝑋∨𝑌 holds, and also 𝑋∨𝑍; hence
(𝑋∨𝑌) & (𝑋∨𝑍) also holds. In the second case
𝑌&𝑍 holds, which means that both 𝑌 and 𝑍 hold.
From 𝑌 follows 𝑋∨𝑌; from 𝑍 follows 𝑋∨𝑍. Thus
(𝑋∨𝑌)&(𝑋∨𝑍) again holds. The latter formula
has thus been derived, in general, from 𝑋∨(𝑌&𝑍),
i.e.,

(𝑋∨(𝑌&𝑍))⊃((𝑋∨𝑌)&(𝑋∨𝑍)) holds.

1.2. *Second example*:
(∃𝑥∀𝑦𝐹𝑥𝑦)⊃(∀𝑦∃𝑥𝐹𝑥𝑦).
(H–A, formula 36, p. 60). The argument runs
as follows: Suppose there is an 𝑥 such that for all 𝑦
𝐹𝑥𝑦 holds. Let 𝑎 be such an 𝑥. Then for all 𝑦: 𝐹𝑎𝑦
holds. Now let 𝑏 be an arbitrary object. Then 𝐹𝑎𝑏
holds. Thus there is an 𝑥, viz., 𝑎, such that 𝐹𝑥𝑏
holds. Since 𝑏 was arbitrary, our result therefore
holds for all objects, i.e., for all 𝑦 there is an 𝑥, such
that 𝐹𝑥𝑦 holds. This yields our assertion.

1.3. *Third example*:
(⌐∃𝑥𝐹𝑥)⊃(∀𝑦⌐𝐹𝑦) is to be recognized as
intuitionistically valid. We reason as follows:
Assume there were no 𝑥 for which 𝐹𝑥 held. From
this we wish to infer: For all 𝑦, ⌐𝐹𝑦 holds. Now
suppose 𝑎 were some object for which 𝐹𝑎 held. It
would then follow that there was an 𝑥 for which
𝐹𝑥 held, viz., 𝑎 would be such an object. This
contradicts our hypothesis that ⌐∃𝑥𝐹𝑥. We have
therefore a contradiction, i.e., 𝐹𝑎 cannot hold. But
since 𝑎 was completely arbitrary, it follows that for
all 𝑦, ⌐𝐹𝑦 holds. Q.E.D.

We intend now to integrate proofs of the kind
carried out in these three examples in an exactly
defined calculus (in §4, we shall show how these
examples are presented in that calculus).

§2.

*Construction of the Calculus 𝒩𝒥*

2.1. We intend now to present a calculus for
"natural" intuitionist derivations of valid formulae.

The restriction to intuitionist reasoning is only
provisional; we shall explain below (cf. §5) our
reasons for doing so and shall show in what
way the calculus has to be extended for classical
reasoning (by including the law of the excluded
middle).

Externally, the essential difference between
"𝒩𝒥-derivations" and derivations in the systems of
Russell, Hilbert, and Heyting is the following: In
the latter systems true formulae are derived from a
series of "logical basic formulae" by means of a
few forms of inference. Natural deduction, however,
does not, in general, start from logical basic pro-
positions, but rather from *assumptions* (cf. examples
in §1) to which logical deductions are applied. By
means of a later inference the result is then again
made independent of the assumption.

Calculi of the former kind will be referred to as
*logistic* calculi.

**2.2.** After this preliminary remark we define the
concept of an 𝒩𝒥-*derivation* as follows:

(Examples in §4).

An 𝒩𝒥-derivation consists of formulae ordered
in tree form ([I, 3.3]).

(By demanding that the formulae are in tree
form we are deviating somewhat from the analogy
with actual reasoning. This is so, since in actual
reasoning we necessarily have (1) a linear sequence
of propositions due to the linear ordering of our
utterances, and (2) we are accustomed to applying
repeatedly a result once it has been obtained,
whereas the tree form permits only of a single use
of a derived formula. These two deviations permit
us to define the concept of a derivation in a more
convenient form and are purely external.)

The initial formulae of the derivation are
*assumption formulae*. Each of these is correlated
with precisely one 𝒟-inference figure (and in
fact occurs "above" [I, 3.5] the lower formula
of that figure, as will be explained more fully
below).

All formulae that occur below an assumption
formula, but still above the lower formula of the
𝒟-inference figure with which that assumption
formula is correlated, that assumption formula
is not included, are said to be *dependent* on the
assumption formula.

(Thus the inference makes all succeeding pro-
positions independent of the assumption which is
correlated with it.)

According to what we have said the endformula
of the derivation depends on no assumption
formula.
