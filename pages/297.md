∀-*IS*: Γ ⟶ Θ, **Fa** / Γ ⟶ Θ, ∀**xFx**'

∃-*IA*: **Fa**, Γ ⟶ Θ / ∃**xFx**, Γ ⟶ Θ'

*Restrictions on Variables:* The object variable in
the last two schemata, which is designated by **a** and
is called the *proper variable* of the ∀-*IS* (∃-*IA*), must
not occur in the lower sequent of the inference
figure (i.e., not in Γ, Θ, and **Fx**).

∀-*IA*: **Fa**, Γ ⟶ Θ / ∀**xFx**, Γ ⟶ Θ'

¬-*IS*: A, Γ ⟶ Θ / Γ ⟶ Θ, ¬ A'

∃-*IS*: Γ ⟶ Θ, **Fa** / Γ ⟶ Θ, ∃**xFx**'

¬-*IA*: Γ ⟶ Θ, A / ¬ A, Γ ⟶ Θ'

⊃-*IS*: A, Γ ⟶ Θ, B / Γ ⟶ Θ, A ⊃ B'

⊃-*IA*: Γ ⟶ Θ, A    B, Δ ⟶ Λ / A ⊃ B, Γ, Δ ⟶ Θ, Λ

## Some Remarks Concerning the Calculi LJ and LK

### The Hauptsatz

(We shall make no further use, in this paper, of
remarks 2.1 to 2.3.)

2.1. The schemata are not all mutually inde-
pendent, i.e., certain schemata could be eliminated
with the help of the remaining ones. Yet if they
were left out, the "*Hauptsatz*" would no longer be
valid.

2.2. In general, we could *simplify* the calculi in
various respects if we attached no importance to
the *Hauptsatz*. To indicate this briefly: the infer-
ence figures &–IS, ∨–IA, &–IA, ∨–IS, ∀–IA,
∃–IS, ⊃–IS, ¬–IA, and ∀–IA in the calculus *LK*
could be replaced by the basic schemata according to
the following schemata:

A, B⟶A&B   A ∨ B⟶A, B   A&B⟶A
A&B⟶B   A⟶A ∨ B   B⟶A ∨ B   ∀xFx⟶Fa
Fa⟶∃xFx   ⊃A, ¬A   (law of the excluded
middle)

¬A, A⟶ (law of contradiction), A ⊃ B, A⟶B.

These basic sequents and our inference figures
may easily be shown to be equivalent.

The same possibility exists for the calculus *LJ*,
with the exception of the inference figures ∨–IA
and ¬–IA, since *LJ*-D-sequents may not in fact
contain two *S*-formulae in the succedent (cf. V,
§5).

2.3. The distinction between *intuitionist* and
*classical* logic is, externally, of a quite different
nature in the calculi *LJ* and *LK* from that in the
calculi *NJ* and *NK*. In the case of the latter, the
distinction rests on the inclusion or exclusion of the
law of the excluded middle, whereas for the
calculi *LJ* and *LK* the difference is characterized by
the restrictions on the succedent. (The fact that
both distinctions are equivalent will become
evident as a result of the equivalence proofs in
Section V for all calculi discussed in this paper.)

2.4. If ⊃–IS and the ⊃–IA are excluded, the
calculus *LK* is *dual* in the following sense. If we
reverse all sequents of an *LK*-derivation (in which
the ⊃–symbols does not occur), i.e., if for A₁, . . . ,
Aₘ⟶B₁, . . . , Bₙ we put Bₙ, . . . , B₁⟶Aₘ, . . . ,
A₁; and if we exchange, in inference figures with
two upper sequents, the right and left-hand upper
sequents, including their derivations, and also
exchange the inference of & by ∨, ∀ by ∃, ∨ by
&, and ∃ by ∀ (in the case of & and ∨ we also
