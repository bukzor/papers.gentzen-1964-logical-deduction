    4 We take the symbols V , ^, 3 from Russell. Russell's symbols for "and," "equivalent," "not," "all," viz : , =, ~} ( ), are
already being used with a different meaning in mathematics. We shall therefore take Hubert's &, whereas Hubert's symbols
for equivalence, all, and not, viz.: ^, ( ), -, again have already different meanings. Besides, the negation symbol represents
a departure from the linear arrangement of symbols and is inconvenient for some purposes. We shall therefore use Heyting's
symbols for equivalence and negation, and for "all" we shall use a symbol [namely V"] corresponding to 3.
