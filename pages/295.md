inference figure which "introduces" the symbol—as
the terminal symbol of a formula—and one which
"eliminates" it. The fact that the inference figures
&¬E and ∨¬I each have two forms constitutes a
trivial, purely external deviation and is of no
interest. The introductions represent, as it were, the
"definitions" of the symbols concerned, and the
eliminations are no more, in the final analysis, than
the consequences of these definitions. This fact may
be expressed as follows: In eliminating a symbol,
the formula whose terminal symbol we are dealing
with, may be used only "in the sense afforded
it by the introduction of that symbol." An example
may clarify what is meant: We were able to
introduce the formula **A ⊃ B** when there existed a
derivation of **B** from the assumption formula **A**. If
we then wished to use that formula by eliminating
the ⊃-symbol [we could, of course, also use it to
form longer formulae, e.g., (**A ⊃ B**) ∨ **C**, ∨¬I], we
could do this precisely by inferring **B** directly, once
**A** has been proved, for what **A ⊃ B** attests is just
the existence of a derivation of **B** from **A**. Note that
in saying this we need not go into the "intuitive
sense" of the ⊃-symbol.

By making these ideas more precise it should be
possible to display the *E*-inferences as single-
valued functions of their corresponding *I*-infer-
ences, on the basis of certain requirements.

5.2. It is possible to eliminate the negation from
our calculus by regarding ¬ **A** as an abbreviation
of **A⊃F**. This is permissible, since by replacing
every ¬ **A** by **A⊃F**, and thus removing all ¬-
symbols from an *NJ*-derivation, we obtain another
*NJ*-derivation (the inference figures ¬¬*I* and
¬¬*E* then become special cases of the ⊃¬*I* and the
⊃¬*E*) and vice versa: If we replace every occur-
rence of **A⊃F** by ¬**A** in an *NJ*-derivation, we
obtain another *NJ*-derivation.

The inference figure schema **D̄** occupies a special
place among the schemata: It does not belong to a
logical symbol, but to the propositional symbol **F**.
5.3. The "*law of the excluded middle*" and the
*calculus NK*.

From the calculus *NJ* we obtain a complete
classical calculus *NK* by adding the "law of the
excluded middle" (*tertium non datur*), i.e.: As
initial formulae of a derivation we now also allow
in addition to the assumption formulae, "basic
formulae" of the form **A** ∨ ¬**A**, where **A** is to be
replaced by an arbitrary formula.

Actually, instead of the law of the excluded
middle, in a purely exterior way, a special position,

and we have done this because we considered that
formulation the "most natural." It would be
perfectly feasible to introduce a new inference

figure schema, say ¬¬A (a schema analogous to
                    A
the one formed by Hilbert and Heyting) in place
of the basic formula schema A ∨ ¬A. However,
such a schema still falls outside the framework of
the 𝒩𝒥-inference figures, because it represents a
new elimination of the negation whose admissi-
bility does not follow at all from our method of
introducing the ¬-symbol by the ¬-𝐼.

## SECTION III.

**DEDUCTIVE CALCULI LJ, LK AND THE HAUPTSATZ**

### §1.

*The Calculi LJ and LK*
*(Logistic Intuitionist and Classical Calculus)*

**1.1.** Preliminary remarks concerning the con-
struction of the calculi *LJ* and *LK*.

What we want to do is to formulate a deductive
calculus (for predicate logic) which is "logistic" on
the one hand, i.e., in which the derivations do not,
as in the calculus 𝒩𝒥, contain assumption formulae,
and which, on the other hand, takes over from the
calculus 𝒩𝒥 the division of the forms of inference
into introductions and eliminations of the various
logical symbols.

The most obvious method of converting an 𝒩𝒥-
derivation into a logistic one is this: We replace a
derivation **B**, which depends on the assumption
formulae **A**₁, . . . , **A**ₙ, by the new formula (**A**₁&
. . . &**A**ₙ) ⊃ **B**. This we do in all *D*-formulae.

We thus obtain formulae which are already valid
*in themselves*, i.e., whose truth is no longer *conditional*
on the truth of certain assumption formulae. This
procedure, however, introduces the new logical
symbols & and ⊃, necessitating additional
inference figures for & and ⊃, and thus upsets the
systematic character of our method of introducing
and eliminating symbols. For this reason we have
introduced the concept of a *sequent* (I, 2.3).
Instead of the formula (**A**₁& . . . &**A**ₙ) ⊃**B**, e.g.,
we therefore write the sequent

**A**₁, . . . , **A**ₙ —> **B**

The sequent does not distinguish itself from the
above formula in its intuitive meaning, but only in
its formal structure (cf. I, 2.4).
