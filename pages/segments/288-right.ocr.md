I can see this is the right column of page 288. It contains text discussing logical deduction, with references to Paul Bernays, predicate logic, and classical logic. There are some formatting elements like italics and superscript footnote markers. Let me transcribe this carefully, maintaining the formatting as requested.

The text appears to be:
- First paragraph ending with Paul Bernays and "(Part I)"
- A "SYNOPSIS" heading
- Several paragraphs discussing investigations into logical deduction
- Contains italicized terms like "predicate logic", "classical logic", "intuitionist logic", and "calculus of natural deduction"
- Has footnote markers (superscript numbers)
- Some quoted text like "lower functional calculus" and "NK"

current interest, and an English edition of this
treatise is to be very much welcomed.

PAUL BERNAYS

(Part I)

SYNOPSIS

The investigations that follow concern the
domain of *predicate logic*, called by H-A¹ the "lower
functional calculus." It comprises the types of
inference that are continually used in all parts of
mathematics. What remains to be added to these
are axioms for the various of inference laws to be
considered as being proper to the particular
branches of mathematics, e.g., in elementary
number theory the axioms of the natural numbers,
of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, as
well as the inference of complete induction, in
geometry the geometric axioms.

In addition to *classical logic* I shall also deal with
*intuitionist logic* as formalized, for example, by
Heyting².

The present investigations into classical and
intuitionist predicate logic fall essentially into two
more closely connected parts.

1. My starting point was this: The formalization
of logical deduction, especially as it has been
developed by Frege, Russell, and Hilbert, is rather
far removed from the forms of deduction used in
practice in mathematical proofs. Considerable
formal advantages are achieved in return. I
intended, first of all, to set up a formal system which
came as close as possible to actual reasoning. The
result was a "*calculus of natural deduction*." ("*NJ*"
for intuitionism, "*NK*" for classical predicate logic.)
This calculus then turned out to have specific pro-
perties; in particular, the "law of the excluded
middle," which intuitionists reject, occupies a
special position.
