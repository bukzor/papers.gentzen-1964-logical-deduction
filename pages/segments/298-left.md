have to change the respective scope of the symbols,
e.g., for B ∨ A we have to put A&B), then another
*LK*-derivation results.

This can be seen at once from the schemata.
(Special care was taken to order them in such a way
as to bring out this relation).

(Cf. H-A's duality principle, p. 62).

2.41. In any case, the ⊃-symbol may, in a well-
known manner, be eliminated from the calculus
𝒩𝒦, by regarding A⊃B as an abbreviation for
(¬A) ∨ B. It may easily be shown that the
schemata for the ⊃-𝒥 and the ⊃-𝒮ℐ can then be
replaced by the schemata for ∨ and ¬.

The calculus 𝒩𝒥 has no corresponding property.

2.5. The most important fact for us with regard
to the calculi 𝒵𝒥 and 𝒵𝒦 is the following:

**Hauptsatz.** Every 𝒵𝒥- or 𝒵𝒦-derivation can be
transformed into an 𝒵𝒥- or 𝒵𝒦-derivation that has
the same endsequent and in which the inference
figure termed a "cut" does not occur.

2.51. The proof follows in §3.

In order to give greater clarity to the meaning of
the *Hauptsatz*, we prove a simple corollary (2.513).

For this purpose we introduce a number of
expressions (which will be needed frequently later
on) relating to operational inference figures.

2.511. That 𝒮-formula which contains the logical
symbol in its schema will be called the *principal
formula* of an inference figure.

For the &-𝒮ℐ and the &-𝒮𝒜 this is simply the
𝒮-formula of the form A&B; for the ∨-𝒮ℐ and the
∨-𝒮𝒜 it is A ∨ B; for the ∀-𝒮ℐ and the ∀-𝒮𝒜 it is
∀xℱx; for the ∃-𝒮ℐ and the ∃-𝒮𝒜 it is ∃xℱx; for the
¬-𝒮ℐ and the ¬-𝒮𝒜 it is ¬A; and for the ⊃-𝒮ℐ
and the ⊃-𝒮𝒜 it is A⊃B.

The 𝒮-formulae designated by A, B, ℱa in the
schemata we call *side formulae* of their correspond-
ing inference figures.

They are always subformulae of the principal
formula (according to the definition of a subformula
in I, 2.2).

2.512. We can now easily read off the following
facts from the inference figure schemata: A
principal formula occurs always in the lower
sequent, a side formula always in the upper
sequent or in one upper sequent.

In the case of a formula occurring as an 𝒮-
formula in an upper sequent of an arbitrary
inference figure without being a side formula or the
D of a cut, it occurs also in the lower sequent as an
𝒮-formula.

These two facts entail the following:

If anywhere in an 𝒵𝒥- or 𝒵𝒦-derivation a
