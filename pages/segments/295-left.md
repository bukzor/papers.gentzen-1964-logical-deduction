inference figure which "introduces" the symbol—as
the terminal symbol of a formula—and one which
"eliminates" it. The fact that the inference figures
&¬E and ∨¬I each have two forms constitutes a
trivial, purely external deviation and is of no
interest. The introductions represent, as it were, the
"definitions" of the symbols concerned, and the
eliminations are no more, in the final analysis, than
the consequences of these definitions. This fact may
be expressed as follows: In eliminating a symbol,
the formula whose terminal symbol we are dealing
with, may be used only "in the sense afforded
it by the introduction of that symbol." An example
may clarify what is meant: We were able to
introduce the formula **A ⊃ B** when there existed a
derivation of **B** from the assumption formula **A**. If
we then wished to use that formula by eliminating
the ⊃-symbol [we could, of course, also use it to
form longer formulae, e.g., (**A ⊃ B**) ∨ **C**, ∨¬I], we
could do this precisely by inferring **B** directly, once
**A** has been proved, for what **A ⊃ B** attests is just
the existence of a derivation of **B** from **A**. Note that
in saying this we need not go into the "intuitive
sense" of the ⊃-symbol.

By making these ideas more precise it should be
possible to display the *E*-inferences as single-
valued functions of their corresponding *I*-infer-
ences, on the basis of certain requirements.

5.2. It is possible to eliminate the negation from
our calculus by regarding ¬ **A** as an abbreviation
of **A⊃F**. This is permissible, since by replacing
every ¬ **A** by **A⊃F**, and thus removing all ¬-
symbols from an *NJ*-derivation, we obtain another
*NJ*-derivation (the inference figures ¬¬*I* and
¬¬*E* then become special cases of the ⊃¬*I* and the
⊃¬*E*) and vice versa: If we replace every occur-
rence of **A⊃F** by ¬**A** in an *NJ*-derivation, we
obtain another *NJ*-derivation.

The inference figure schema **D̄** occupies a special
place among the schemata: It does not belong to a
logical symbol, but to the propositional symbol **F**.
5.3. The "*law of the excluded middle*" and the
*calculus NK*.

From the calculus *NJ* we obtain a complete
classical calculus *NK* by adding the "law of the
excluded middle" (*tertium non datur*), i.e.: As
initial formulae of a derivation we now also allow
in addition to the assumption formulae, "basic
formulae" of the form **A** ∨ ¬**A**, where **A** is to be
replaced by an arbitrary formula.

Actually, instead of the law of the excluded
middle, in a purely exterior way, a special position,
