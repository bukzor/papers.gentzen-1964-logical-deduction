Now I need to transcribe this image content to markdown. The image appears to be page 291 (right column) of a document about logical deduction. It contains several numbered paragraphs (3.4, 3.5) and definitions related to D-formulae, branches, and derivations. There's also a Section II heading about "The Calculus of Natural Deduction" with a ยง 1 subsection about "Examples of Natural Deduction".

I need to:
1. Preserve all the text exactly as it appears
2. Use proper markdown formatting
3. Maintain italics where they appear (like "same", "above", "below", "basic formulae", "assumption formulae")
4. Add empty lines before each paragraph as requested

"Two distinct *D*-formulae (i.e., formulae occur-
ring merely in distinct places in the derivation) are
formally identical, viz., identical to the same
formula."

By saying "**A is the *same D*-formula as B**" we mean
that **A** and **B** are not only formally identical, but
occur also in the same place in the derivation. We
shall use the words "formally identical" to indicate
identity of form regardless of place.

For object variables, however, we shall not
introduce a special term that would associate the
variable with a specific place of occurrence in the
formula. Thus we say, e.g.: "*The same* object
variable occurs in two distinct *D*-formulae."

3.4. The inference figures of the derivation are
called *D-inference figures* (i.e., derivation inference
figures).

In a derivation consisting of sequents the *S*-
formulae of the *D*-sequents are called *D-S-
formulae* (i.e., derivation sequent formulae).

3.5. A *branch* in a derivation is (following Hilbert)
a series of *D*-formulae whose first formula is an
initial formula and whose last formula is the end-
formula, and of which each formula except the last
is an upper formula of a *D*-inference figure whose
lower formula is the next formula in the branch.

We say that "a *D*-formula stands *above* (*below*)
another *D*-formula" if there exists a branch in
which the former occurs before (after) the latter.

We are here thinking of the fact that a derivation
is written in tree form with the initial formula
above and the endformula below. (Examples may
be found in II, ยง4).

Furthermore, we say that "a *D*-inference figure
occurs above (below) a *D*-formula," if all formulae
of the inference figure occur above (below) that
*D*-formula.

A derivation with the endformula **A** is also called
a "derivation of **A**."

The initial formulae of a derivation may be *basic
formulae* or *assumption formulae*; more about their
nature will have to be said as we reach the different
calculi.

SECTION II.

THE CALCULUS OF NATURAL DEDUCTION

ยง 1

*Examples of Natural Deduction*

We wish to set up a formalism that reflects as
accurately as possible the actual logical reasoning
involved in mathematical proofs.
