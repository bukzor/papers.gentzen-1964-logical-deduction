both Ψ and Ξ always remain empty. (Γ corresponds
to the Θ of the inference figure.) Thus we have the
case which is symmetric to 3.121.221. Further-
more, Γ is equal to **M**, i.e., Γ* is empty, and Π
contains at most one formula. Hence, in the
derivation there never in fact occurs more than one
formula in the succedent of a sequent.

The case of a ∨-*IA* is symmetric to 3.121.231.
Again, Γ is equal to **M**, Γ* is empty, and Π con-
tains at most one formula; all is thus in order.

There now remains the case of a ⊃-*IA*, i.e.,
3.122.1. In an *LJ*- ⊃-*IA*, the Θ of the schema
(1.22) is empty. Thus we have the case set out
under 3.122.12. Λ* is also empty, and Π contains
at most one formula, which means that here, too,
we again obtain an *LJ*-derivation from an *LJ*-
derivation.
