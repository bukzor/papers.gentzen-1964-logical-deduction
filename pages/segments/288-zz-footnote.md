appeared under the same title, *ibid.*, pp. 405–431. The *American Philosophical Quarterly* plans to publish this at a later date. The
present English translation is by Mr. M. E. Szabo (McGill University, Montreal) whose thanks are due to his wife Ann
for her continued encouragement, and to Mr. Michael Dummett of All Souls College, Oxford, for reading the translation
and suggesting improvements.
