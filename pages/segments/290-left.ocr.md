<thinking>
I can see this is a page from what appears to be a logical or mathematical text. It contains numbered sections (1.3, 2, 2.1, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.2) discussing concepts like variables, expressions, formulas, and logical symbols. 

Key elements I need to transcribe:
- Multiple paragraphs with section numbers
- Some italic terms like "arguments", "elementary formulae"
- Mathematical notation including symbols like ⊃, ∀, ∃, ¬, ∧, ∨
- A mathematical expression/example
- Proper formatting with indentation and line breaks

Let me transcribe this carefully, maintaining the structure and formatting.

We assume that an indefinite number of variables
is available; if the alphabet does not suffice, we add
numerical subscripts such as x₇, C₃.

1.3. Boldface and Greek letters serve as "syn-
tactic variables," i.e., not as symbols of the logic
formalized, but as variables of our considerations
*concerning* that logic. Their meaning is explained as
they are used.

2. *Expressions*.

2.1. The concept of a propositional expression,
called a "*formula*" for short (defined inductively):
(The concept of a formula is ordinarily used in a
more general sense; the special case defined below
might thus perhaps be described as a "purely
logical formula.")

2.11. A symbol for a particular proposition (i.e.,
capital letter A and F) is a formula.

A propositional variable followed by a number
(possibly zero) of free object variables is a formula,
e.g., *Abab*.

The object variables are called the *arguments* of
the propositional variables.

Formulae of the two kinds mentioned are also
called *elementary formulae*.

2.12. If A is a formula, then ¬ A is also a
formula.

If A and B are formulae, then A&B, A∨B,
A⊃B are formulae.

(We shall not introduce the symbol ⊃⊂ into
our presentation; it is in fact superfluous, since
A⊃⊂B may be regarded as an abbreviation of
(A⊃B) & (B⊃A).)

2.13. A formula not containing the bound object
variable x yields another formula, if we prefix
either ∀x or ∃x. At the same time we may substi-
tute x in a number of places for a free object
variable occurring in the formula.

2.14. Brackets (or parentheses) are to be used to
show the structure of a formula unequivocally.
Example of a formula:

∃x ( ( (¬Abxa) ∨ Bx) ⊃ (∀ z(A&B) ) )

By special convention the number of brackets
may be reduced, but (with one exception, *vide* 2.4)
no use will be made of this, since we do not have to
write down many formulae.

2.2. The number of logical symbols occurring in
a formula is called the *grade of a formula*. (Thus an
elementary formula is of grade 0.)

The logical symbol of a non-elementary formula
that has been added last, in the construction of the
formula according to 2.11 and 2.12, is called the
*terminal symbol of a formula*.
