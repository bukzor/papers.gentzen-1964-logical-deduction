3.102. This is achieved by re-designating the free
object variables in the following way:

We take a ∀–*IS* (∃–*IA*) above whose lower
sequent either no further inference figures of this
kind occur, or if they do, they have already been
dealt with in a way to be outlined.

In all sequents above the lower sequent of this
inference figure we replace the proper variables by
one and the same free object variable which, so
far, has not yet occurred in the derivation. This
obviously leaves the validity of the ∀–*IS* (∃–*IA*)
as such unchanged. (The proper variables did in
fact not occur in its lower sequent.) Furthermore
the remainder of the derivation remains correct, as
is shown by the immediately following lemma:

By applying this method systematically to every
single ∀–*IS* and ∃–*IA*, the derivation thus remains
correct throughout and at the conclusion obviously
has the desired property (3.101). Furthermore, as
was essential, the grade and rank of the derivation
as well as its endsequent have remained unaltered.

3.103. Now we give the still outstanding proof of
the following *lemma*. (It is enunciated in a some-
what more general form than is immediately
necessary, since we shall have to apply it again
later on (3.113.33).)

"An *LK*-basic sequent or inference figure turns into
a basic sequent or inference figure of the same
kind, if we replace a free object variable, which is *not
the proper variable* of the inference figure, in all its
occurrences in the basic sequent or inference figure, by
one and the same free object variable, provided again
that that is *not the proper variable* of the inference
figure."

This holds trivially except for the ∀–*IS*, the
∀–*IA*, the ∃–*IS* and the ∃–*IA*. Yet even here there
is no cause for concern: the restrictions on variables
are not violated, since we may neither substitute
nor replace the proper variable. (This is the reason
why both restrictions on variables are necessary.)
Furthermore, the formula resulting from **Fa** is still
obtained by substituting a for x in the formula
resulting from **Fx**.

Having prepared the way (3.10), we now
proceed to the actual transformation of the
derivation which serves to eliminate the mix
occurring in it.

As already mentioned, we distinguish two cases:
ρ = 2 (3.11) and ρ > 2 (3.12).

3.11. Suppose ρ = 2.

We distinguish between a number of particular
cases of which we specify only the first (3.111)
