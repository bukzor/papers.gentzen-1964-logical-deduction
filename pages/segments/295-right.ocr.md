and we have done this because we considered that
formulation the "most natural." It would be
perfectly feasible to introduce a new inference

figure schema, say ¬¬A (a schema analogous to
                    A
the one formed by Hilbert and Heyting) in place
of the basic formula schema A ∨ ¬A. However,
such a schema still falls outside the framework of
the 𝒩𝒥-inference figures, because it represents a
new elimination of the negation whose admissi-
bility does not follow at all from our method of
introducing the ¬-symbol by the ¬-𝐼.

## SECTION III.

**DEDUCTIVE CALCULI LJ, LK AND THE HAUPTSATZ**

### §1.

*The Calculi LJ and LK*
*(Logistic Intuitionist and Classical Calculus)*

**1.1.** Preliminary remarks concerning the con-
struction of the calculi *LJ* and *LK*.

What we want to do is to formulate a deductive
calculus (for predicate logic) which is "logistic" on
the one hand, i.e., in which the derivations do not,
as in the calculus 𝒩𝒥, contain assumption formulae,
and which, on the other hand, takes over from the
calculus 𝒩𝒥 the division of the forms of inference
into introductions and eliminations of the various
logical symbols.

The most obvious method of converting an 𝒩𝒥-
derivation into a logistic one is this: We replace a
derivation **B**, which depends on the assumption
formulae **A**₁, . . . , **A**ₙ, by the new formula (**A**₁&
. . . &**A**ₙ) ⊃ **B**. This we do in all *D*-formulae.

We thus obtain formulae which are already valid
*in themselves*, i.e., whose truth is no longer *conditional*
on the truth of certain assumption formulae. This
procedure, however, introduces the new logical
symbols & and ⊃, necessitating additional
inference figures for & and ⊃, and thus upsets the
systematic character of our method of introducing
and eliminating symbols. For this reason we have
introduced the concept of a *sequent* (I, 2.3).
Instead of the formula (**A**₁& . . . &**A**ₙ) ⊃**B**, e.g.,
we therefore write the sequent

**A**₁, . . . , **A**ₙ —> **B**

The sequent does not distinguish itself from the
above formula in its intuitive meaning, but only in
its formal structure (cf. I, 2.4).
