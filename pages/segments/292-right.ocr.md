I can see this is the right column of page 292 from the document. The text discusses the restriction to intuitionist reasoning, the difference between NJ-derivations and other logical systems, and defines the concept of an NJ-derivation. There are several mathematical symbols and italicized terms that need to be properly formatted. Let me transcribe this carefully with proper markdown formatting and manual text wrapping.

The restriction to intuitionist reasoning is only
provisional; we shall explain below (cf. §5) our
reasons for doing so and shall show in what
way the calculus has to be extended for classical
reasoning (by including the law of the excluded
middle).

Externally, the essential difference between
"𝒩𝒥-derivations" and derivations in the systems of
Russell, Hilbert, and Heyting is the following: In
the latter systems true formulae are derived from a
series of "logical basic formulae" by means of a
few forms of inference. Natural deduction, however,
does not, in general, start from logical basic pro-
positions, but rather from *assumptions* (cf. examples
in §1) to which logical deductions are applied. By
means of a later inference the result is then again
made independent of the assumption.

Calculi of the former kind will be referred to as
*logistic* calculi.

**2.2.** After this preliminary remark we define the
concept of an 𝒩𝒥-*derivation* as follows:

(Examples in §4).

An 𝒩𝒥-derivation consists of formulae ordered
in tree form ([I, 3.3]).

(By demanding that the formulae are in tree
form we are deviating somewhat from the analogy
with actual reasoning. This is so, since in actual
reasoning we necessarily have (1) a linear sequence
of propositions due to the linear ordering of our
utterances, and (2) we are accustomed to applying
repeatedly a result once it has been obtained,
whereas the tree form permits only of a single use
of a derived formula. These two deviations permit
us to define the concept of a derivation in a more
convenient form and are purely external.)

The initial formulae of the derivation are
*assumption formulae*. Each of these is correlated
with precisely one 𝒟-inference figure (and in
fact occurs "above" [I, 3.5] the lower formula
of that figure, as will be explained more fully
below).

All formulae that occur below an assumption
formula, but still above the lower formula of the
𝒟-inference figure with which that assumption
formula is correlated, that assumption formula
is not included, are said to be *dependent* on the
assumption formula.

(Thus the inference makes all succeeding pro-
positions independent of the assumption which is
correlated with it.)

According to what we have said the endformula
of the derivation depends on no assumption
formula.
