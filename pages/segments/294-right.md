In this example the tree form must appear
somewhat artificial since it does not bring out the
fact that it is *after* the enunciation of X ∨ (Y & Z)
that we distinguish the cases X, Y & Z.

Second example (1.2):

```txt
                            ∀y Fay
                            ―――――  ∀-E
                             Fab        
                    2                   ∃-I
                             ∃x Fxb    ――――
        ∃x ∀y Fxy      ∀y ∃x Fxy      ∀-I
        ―――――――――      ―――――――――      ∃-E 1
           ∀y ∃x Fxy                   
                                       ⊃-I 2
    (∃x ∀y Fxy) ⊃ (∀y ∃x Fxy)
```

If we were to use *linear* ordering, then here too
the assumption of the ∃-E would quite naturally
*follow* the upper formula on the left, as was the
case in our treatment of that example in §1.

Third example (1.3):

```txt
        2                1
       ――                
       Fa    ∃-I         
      ―――――              ┐ ∃xFx
      ∃xFx               ┐      ┐-E
                   F            
                        
                   ┐ Fa  ┐-I2
                   ――――――
                        
       ∀y ┐ Fy    ∀-I
       ―――――――         
                              ⊃-I1
    (┐ ∃xFx) ⊃ (∀y ┐ Fy)
```

*Some Remarks Concerning the Calculus NJ.*
*The Calculus NK*

5.1. The calculus NJ lacks a certain formal
elegance. This has to be put against the following
advantages:

5.11. A close affinity to actual reasoning, which
had been our fundamental aim in setting up the
calculus. The calculus lends itself in particular to
the formalization of mathematical proofs.

5.12. In most cases the derivations for valid
formulae in our calculus are *shorter* than their
counterparts in logistic calculi. This is so primarily
because in logistic derivations one and the same
formula usually occurs (because of times as part
of other formulae), whereas this happens only very
rarely in the case of NJ-derivations.

5.13. The designations given to the various
inference figures (2.21) make it plain that our
calculus is remarkably *systematic*. To every logical
symbol &, ∨, ∀, ∃, ⊃, ┐ there are one or two
