I can see this is page 306 from a mathematical logic paper. It contains:

1. A numbered section (3.232.22) discussing symmetric cases
2. A reference to section 3.121.2 about mix in derivations
3. A logical inference figure showing:
   - Ω → M, Σ → Π
   - Ω, Σ* → Π (where * appears to be superscript)
4. Text explaining conditions where Π contains at most one S-formula
5. Discussion of lower sequent of an LJ-inference figure
6. A list of inference figure schemata (1.21, 1.22)
7. Various logical operations including thinning, contraction, interchange, and logical operators (∨-IA, &-IA, ∃-IA, ∀-IA, ⊃-IA)

Let me transcribe this carefully with proper formatting.

**3.232.22.** In the cases that are symmetric to
**3.121.2**, the mix in the end of the derivation runs:

```txt
      Ω —→ M   Σ —→ Π
      ——————————————————
         Ω, Σ*—→ Π
```

where *Π* contains at most *one* S-formula, and
where **Ω —→ M** is the lower sequent of an *LJ*-
inference figure in which at least one upper
sequent contains **M** as a succedent formula.

If we now look at the inference figure schemata
**1.21, 1.22**, it becomes easily apparent that such an
inference figure can only be a thinning, contraction,
or interchange in the antecedent, or a ∨-*IA*, a
&-*IA*, a ∃-*IA*, a ∀-*IA*, and a ⊃-*IA*. Let us
disregard for the moment the ∨-*IA* and the ⊃-*IA*.
Then all the possibilities enumerated above fall
within the case symmetric to **3.121.1**, where
