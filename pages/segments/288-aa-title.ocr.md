I can see the image clearly. It appears to be the title/header section of an academic paper. Let me transcribe it following the formatting rules:

1. It shows the journal name "American Philosophical Quarterly"
2. Volume and issue information
3. The main title "INVESTIGATIONS INTO LOGICAL DEDUCTION" with a footnote marker
4. The author name "GERHARD GENTZEN"

The title appears to be in a larger font and the text is centered. I should preserve the structure while converting to markdown.
