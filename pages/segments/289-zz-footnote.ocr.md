This appears to be a footnote discussing logic symbols and Russell's notation. Let me transcribe it carefully, preserving:
- The footnote marker "²"
- The italic text "Hauptsatz"
- The logical symbols (∨, ⊃, ∃, ∼, etc.)
- The special characters and formatting

The text discusses:
1. A reference to Herbrand's proof of the Hauptsatz
2. Russell's symbols and their meanings
3. Heyting's symbols for equivalence and their differences from Russell's
</thinking>

² An important special case of the *Hauptsatz* had already been proved in a completely different way by Herbrand, cf. Section
iv, §2.

³ We take the symbols ∨, ⊃, ∃ from Russell. Russell's symbols for "and," "equivalent," "not," "all," viz: •, ≡, ∼, ( ), are
already being used with a different meaning in mathematics. We shall therefore take Hilbert's &, whereas Hilbert's symbols
for equivalence, all, and not, viz.: ∼, ( ), ¯, again have already different meanings. Besides, the negation symbol represents
a departure from the linear arrangement of symbols and is inconvenient for some purposes. We shall therefore use Heyting's
symbols for equivalence and negation, and for "all" we shall use the inverted German A [namely: ∀] common to ∃.
