Now I need to transcribe this image to markdown following the specific formatting rules:
- Manual text wrapping
- Empty line before each paragraph
- Use markdown notation for bold and italic
- Make full use of unicode
- Use ```txt for diagrams/formulas
- Ensure vertical alignment in diagrams

The image contains mathematical text with logical derivations, sequents, and some special formatting. I'll need to carefully preserve the mathematical notation and structure.

This is transformed into:

```txt
Γ₁⟶ Θ₁, Fb    Fb, Γ₂⟶ Θ₂
─────────────────────────── mix
Γ₁, Γ₂*⟶ Θ₁*, Θ₂ possibly several thinnings
─────────────────── and interchanges.
Γ₁, Γ₂⟶ Θ₁, Θ₂
```

Above the left-hand upper sequent of the mix,
Γ₁⟶ Θ₁, **Fb**, we write the same part of the
derivation which previously occurred above
Γ₁⟶ Θ₁, **Fa**, yet having replaced every occurrence
of the free variable **a** by **b**. It follows therefore,
from the lemma 3.103, together with 3.101, that in
performing this operation the part of the deriva-
tion *above* Γ₁⟶ Θ₁, **Fb** has again become a
correct part of the derivation. (By virtue of 3.101
neither **a** nor **b** can be the proper variable of an
inference figure occurring in that part of the
derivation.) The same consideration may be
applied to that part of the derivation which
*includes* the sequent Γ₁⟶ Θ₁, **Fb**, since it too
results from Γ₁⟶ Θ₁, **Fa** by substitution of **b** for
**a**. It is now in fact clear that by virtue of the
occurring free variables for **x**–*IS*, **a** could have
occurred neither in Γ₁ and Θ₁, nor in **Fx**. Further-
more, **Fa** results from **Fx** by substituting **a** for **x**,
and **Fb** from **Fx** by substituting **b** for **x**. This is
why **Fb** results from **Fa** by substituting **b** for **a**.

The mix formula **Fb** in the new derivation has a
lower grade than γ. Therefore, according to the
induction hypothesis, the mix may be eliminated.

3.113.34. Suppose the terminal symbol of **M** is
∃. This case is resolved symmetrically to the
previous one.

3.113.35. Suppose the terminal symbol of **M** is
⊃. Then the end of the derivation runs:

```txt
A, Γ₁⟶Θ₁                    Γ₂⟶Θ₂, A
───────────⊃A  ⊃IS  ⊃A, Γ₂⟶Θ₂        ⊃IA
Γ₁⟶Θ₁, ⊃A       ─────────────────────────
                 Γ₁, Γ₂⟶Θ₁, Θ₂            mix.
```

This is transformed into:

```txt
Γ₂⟶ Θ₂, A    A, Γ₁⟶ Θ₁
───────────────────────── mix
Γ₂, Γ₁*⟶ Θ₂*, Θ₁ possibly several inter-
───────────────────── changes and thinnings.
Γ₁, Γ₂⟶ Θ₁, Θ₂
```

The new mix may be eliminated by virtue of the
induction hypothesis.

3.113.36. Suppose the terminal symbol of **M** is
⊃. Then the end of the derivation runs:
