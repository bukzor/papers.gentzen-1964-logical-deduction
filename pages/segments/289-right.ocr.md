I can see this is the right column of page 289, containing text about formalisms and logical notation. The text discusses:
1. References to Russell, Hilbert, and Heyting formalisms
2. Abbreviations "LHJ" for intuitionist and "LHK" for classical predicate logic
3. Section organization (Sections I-V)
4. Section I on "Stipulation of Terms"
5. Definitions of symbols, expressions, and figures
6. Various types of symbols including constant symbols, variables, etc.

Let me transcribe this carefully, maintaining the formatting and structure.

formalisms of Russell, Hilbert, and Heyting (and
which may easily be compared with them).
("*LHJ*" for intuitionist, "*LHK*" for classical pre-
dicate logic.)

4. Only the first part of my paper containing
Sections I to III is presented here. Sections IV and
V follow in the second part.

**Section I.**

**Stipulation of Terms**

To the concepts "object," "function," "predic-
ate," "proposition," "theorem," "axiom," "proof,"
"inference," etc., in logic and mathematics there
correspond, in the formalization of these disciplines,
certain symbols or combinations of symbols. We
divide these into:

1. *Symbols*.
2. *Expressions*, i.e., finite series of symbols.
3. *Figures*, i.e., finite sets of symbols, with some
ordering.

Symbols count as special cases of expressions and
figures; expressions as special cases of figures.

In this paper we shall consider symbols, expres-
sions, and figures of the following kind:

1. *Symbols*.

These divide into constant symbols and vari-
ables.

1.1 Constant symbols:

*Symbols for particular objects*: 1, 2, 3, . . .

*Symbols for particular functions*: +, −, •.

*Symbols for particular propositions*: **T** ("the true
proposition"), **F** ("the false proposition").

*Symbols for particular predicates*: =, <.

*Logical symbols*: & "and", ∨ "or", ⊃ "if . . .
then," ⊃⊂ "is equivalent to," ¬ "not", ∀
"for all," ∃ "there is a."

We shall also use the terms: conjunction symbol,
disjunction symbol, implication symbol, equiva-
lence symbol, negation symbol, universal quantifier,
existential quantifier.

*Auxiliary symbols*: ), (, →.

1.2 Variables:

*Object variables*. These we divide into *free* object
variables: *a*, *b*, *c*, . . . *m* and *bound* object variables:
*n*, . . . *x*, *y*, *z*.

*Propositional variables*: *A*, *B*, *C*, . . .
