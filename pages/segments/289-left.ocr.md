I can see the left column of page 289 from Gentzen's paper. The text discusses the development of natural deduction calculus and mentions the Hauptsatz (main theorem). I need to transcribe this carefully, maintaining the formatting with proper line breaks and preserving italics. The superscript numbers appear to be footnote references.

I shall develop the calculus of natural deduction
in the second Section of this paper together with
some remarks concerning it.

2. A closer investigation of the specific properties
of this calculus have finally led me to a very
general theorem which will be referred to below as
the "*Hauptsatz*."

The *Hauptsatz*³ says that every purely logical
proof can be reduced to a determinate, though not
unique, normal form. Perhaps we may express the
essential properties of such a normal form by
saying "it is not roundabout." No concepts enter
into the proof other than those contained in its
final result, and their use was therefore essential to
the achievement of that result.

The *Hauptsatz* is valid both for classical and for
intuitionist predicate logic.

In order to be able to enunciate and prove the
*Hauptsatz* in a convenient form, I had to provide a
logical calculus especially suited to the purpose. For
this the natural calculus proved unsuitable. For,
although it already contains the properties essential
to the validity of the *Hauptsatz*, it does so only with
respect to its intuitionist form, in view of the fact
that the law of excluded middle, as pointed out
earlier, occupies a special position in relation to
these properties.

In Section III of this paper, therefore, I shall
develop a new calculus of logical deduction con-
taining all the desired properties in both their
intuitionist and their classical form. ("*LJ*" for
intuitionist, "*LK*" for classical predicate logic.)
The *Hauptsatz* will then be enunciated and proved
by means of that calculus.

The *Hauptsatz* permits of a variety of *applications*.
To illustrate this I shall develop a decision pro-
cedure (IV, §1) for intuitionist propositional logic
in Section IV, and shall in addition give a new
proof of the consistency of classical arithmetic
without complete induction (IV, §3).

Sections III and IV may be read independently
of Section II.

3. Section I contains the stipulation of the terms
and notations used in this paper.

In Section V, I prove the *equivalence* of the logical
calculi *NJ*, *NK*, and *LJ*, *LK*, developed in this
paper, by means of a calculus modeled on the
