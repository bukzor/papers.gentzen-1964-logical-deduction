Now I'll transcribe this image to markdown following the formatting rules. The image shows the left column of page 288, starting with an "INTRODUCTION" heading and the beginning of text about Gerhard Gentzen's dissertation.

Key elements to transcribe:
- The heading "INTRODUCTION" centered
- The body text starting with a large decorative "G" for "GERHARD"
- Italicized title "Untersuchungen über das logische Schliessen"
- Italicized word "Untersuchungen" later in the text

## INTRODUCTION

**G**ERHARD GENTZEN's inaugural disserta-
tion for the University of Göttingen, "*Unter-
suchungen über das logische Schliessen*," of which Mr.
Manfred Szabo here presents an English transla-
tion, is an important step in the deeper analysis of
the logical calculus as it was begun in the thesis of
Jacques Herbrand. In it Gentzen develops a new
form of logical calculus, the "calculus of sequents,"
which he introduces by starting first from a
"natural calculus" and by then transforming it
for his technical purposes. Its central theorem, an
"elimination theorem," is proved in detail in the
first part of the paper. The second part deals with
applications of this elimination theorem as well as
containing the proof of the equivalence of the
calculus of sequents with usual logical
calculus.

The *Untersuchungen* have had a profound
influence on the development of mathematical
logic and proof theory. The treatment of the
calculus of sequents has been extended by Oiva
Ketonen (in Finland) and by Haskell B. Curry (in
the U.S.A.), and the elimination theorem of
Gentzen has been transferred by Kurt Schütte to
the usual logical calculus. The application of the
elimination theorem to proof theory has been
developed by Paul Lorenzen and Kurt Schütte
through the use of "infinitic induction." Lately
Gaisi Takeuti (in Japan) has generalized the
Gentzen calculus to a system of type theory in
which the theory of real numbers can be formalized.
Here the elimination theorem is not yet proved,
but Takeuti shows that upon the assumption of the
generalized elimination theorem the consistency
of his system follows.

Thus Gentzen's *Untersuchungen* are of great
