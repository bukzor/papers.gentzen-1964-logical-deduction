Looking at the image, I can see this is a footnote section with two footnotes marked with asterisk (*) and superscript 1 and 2. The text contains:

1. First footnote (*) about original publication in Mathematische Zeitschrift, with acknowledgements to various people
2. Second footnote (1) referencing Hilbert-Ackermann
3. Third footnote (2) about A. Heyting's work on intuitionistic logic

I need to transcribe this faithfully, using proper markdown formatting while maintaining the structure and ensuring proper text wrapping.

* Originally published in the *Mathematische Zeitschrift*, vol. 39 (1935), pp. 176–221. A second part of these investigations
appeared under the same title, *ibid.*, pp. 405–431. The *American Philosophical Quarterly* plans to publish this at a later date. The
present English translation is by Mr. M. E. Szabo (McGill University, Montreal) whose thanks are due to his wife Ann
for her continued encouragement, and to Mr. Michael Dummett of All Souls College, Oxford, for reading the translation
and suggesting improvements.

¹ Hilbert-Ackermann, *Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik*, in this paper referred to as H–A.

² A. Heyting, *Die formalen Regeln der intuitionistischen Logik und Mathematik*, Sitzungsber. d. Preuß. Akad. d. Wiss., phys.-math.
Kl. 1930, pp. 42–65.
