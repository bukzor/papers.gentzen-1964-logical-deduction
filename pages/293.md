**2.21.** We shall now state the permissible *inference
figures*.

The inference figure schemata below are to be
understood in the following way:

We obtain an 𝒩ℐ-inference figure from one of
the schemata by replacing **A, B, C, D** by arbitrary
formulae; and **∀xFx** (**∃xFx**) by an arbitrary
formula containing ∀ or ∃ for its terminal symbol,
where **x** indicates the bound object variable
belonging to that terminal symbol; and **Fa** by the
formula obtained from **Fx** by replacing the bound
variable **x**, which it contains, by the free object
variable **a**.

(For **a** we may, for instance, take a variable
already occurring in **Fx**. For the inference figures
∀-*I* and ∃-*E*, this possibility will, however, be
excluded by the restriction on variables which
follows below, but it remains for ∀-*E* and ∃-*I*. Nor
need **x** occur at all in **Fx**, in which case **Fa** is, of
course, identical with **Fx**. — **Fa** is obviously always
a subformula of **∀xFx** (**∃xFx**), according to the
definition of a subformula in 1, 2.2.)

Symbols written in square brackets have the
following meaning: An arbitrary number (possibly
zero) of formulae of this form, all formally identical,
may be correlated with the inference figure as
assumption formulae. They must then be initial
formulae of the derivation and, moreover, occur in
branches of proofs to which the particular upper
formula of the inference figure belongs. (I.e. the
upper formula above which the square bracket
occurs in the scheme. This formula may already
itself be an assumption formula.)

The fact that there is a correlation in a derivation
between a *D*-inference figure and the related
assumption formulae must somehow be made
explicit, for example, by jointly numbering them
(cf. examples in §4).

The designations of the various inference figure
schemata: &-*I*, &-*E*, etc., stand for the following:
An inference figure formed according to the particular schema is an "introduction" (*I*) or an "elimination" (*E*) of the conjunction (&), the disjunction
(∨), the universal quantifier (∀), the existential
quantifier (∃), the implication (⊃), or of the
negation (¬). More about this in §5.

∀-I        ∀-E        ∃-I        ∃-E
                                 [Fa]
Fa         ∀xFx       Fa         ∃xFx  C
------     ----       ----       --------
∀xFx       Fa         ∃xFx       C

⊃-I        ⊃-E        ¬-I        ¬-E
[A]                   [A]
B          A  A ⊃ B   F          A  ¬A     F
------     --------   ----       ------    ---
A ⊃ B      B          ¬A         F         D
```

The free object variable of a ∀-*I* or ∃-*E*,
represented by **a** in the respective schema, is called
a *proper variable*. (This, of course, presupposes that
there is such a variable, i.e., that the bound object
variable represented by **x** occurs in the formula
represented by **Fx**.)

*Restrictions on Variables*:

An 𝒩ℐ-derivation is subject to the following
restriction (for the significance of this restriction
cf. §3):

The proper variable of an ∀-*I* must not occur
in the formula represented in the schema by
∀**xFx**, nor in any assumption formula upon which
that formula depends.

The proper variable of an ∃-*E* must not occur in
the formula represented in the schema by ∃**xFx**;
nor in an upper formula represented by **C**; nor in
any assumption formula upon which that formula
depends, with the exception of the assumption
formula represented by **Fa** correlated with the
∃-*E*.

This concludes the definition of the "𝒩ℐ-
derivation."

§3.

*Intuitive Sense of* 𝒩ℐ-*Inference Figures*

We shall explain the intuitive sense of a number
of inference figure schemata and thus try to show
how the calculus in fact reflects "actual reasoning."

⊃-*I*: Expressed in words, this inference corres-
ponds to the following inference: If **B** has been
proved by means of assumption **A**, we have (this
time without the assumption): from **A** follows **B**.
(Further assumptions may, of course, have been
made and which continue to depend on them.)

∨-*E* ("Distinction of Cases"): If **A** ∨ **B** has been
proved, one can distinguish two cases: What one
first assumes is that **A** holds and derives, let us say,
**C** from it. If it is then possible to derive **C** also by
assuming that **B** holds, then **C** holds generally, i.e.,
it is no more dependent on the occurrence of **A**
